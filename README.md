__Pruning__ is an effective method for reducing the size of neural networks. Besides reducing the parameter count, the process _can_ accelerate inference as well. 
CPUs can handle sparse weights just fine, but GPUs need structured weights for an acceleration to happen. 
A structured approach to pruning i.e., removing network channels [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321000868)] or blocks of weights [[paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.829.pdf)], generally yields speedups as well

\+

__Adapters__ [[paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/e7b24b112a44fdd9ee93bdf998c6ca0e-paper.pdf)] have emerged as an alternative to fine-tuning, in which the prior network weights are unaltered, and a new set of _adapters_ weights are added to the network to learn a specific task.
Some types of adapters add new layers, others are _fusible_ with existing weights and don't have a run-time overhead.
When a single base-model is deployed with many specialised models, these structures can save a lot of parameters compared with full fine-tuning.

__Structured Pruning Adapters__ are the offspring of Structured Pruning and Fusible Adapters, and can be used for _Transfer Learning_ which has:
- ‚úÖ Extremely few learned parameters (binary pruning mask + masked adapter weights) üëå
- ‚úÖ Accelerated network inference üèéüí®


## How to use this library
Use in conjunction with any Structured Pruning technique. 
0. Navigate to the repository root.
1. Install the library:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
2. Replace Linear and Conv layers with an SP Adapter:
    ```python3
    from torch.nn import Linear
    from sp_adapter import SPLoRA

    reg_lin = Linear(256, 512, bias=True)
    spa_lin = SPLoRA(reg_lin, rank=32)

    # Or replace all applicable layers in a network
    spa_net = SPLoRA(reg_net, rank=32)
    ```
3. Employ any Structured Pruning method. We conducted extensive experimens with multiple _channel-pruning_  methods (please see the `experiments` repository).

4. Get pruned SP Adapter weights:
    ```python3
    # Specify mask - learned via your choice of Structured Pruning method
    in_features_mask=torch.tensor([1, 0, ..., 1], dtype=torch.bool)
    out_features_mask=torch.tensor([0, 1, ..., 1], dtype=torch.bool)

    # Read parameters
    params = sp_adapters.splora.parameters(
        adapter_weights_only=True,
        in_features_mask=torch.tensor([1, 0, ..., 1], dtype=torch.bool)
        out_features_mask=torch.tensor([0, 1, ..., 1], dtype=torch.bool),
    )   
    named_parameters = sp_adapters.splora.named_parameters(
        adapter_weights_only=True,
        in_features_mask=torch.tensor([1, 0, ..., 1], dtype=torch.bool)
        out_features_mask=torch.tensor([0, 1, ..., 1], dtype=torch.bool),
    )
    ```

### Demo
See also [notebooks/demo.ipynb](notebooks/demo.ipynb) for a hands-on demo.

### Structured Pruning Low-Rank Adapter (SPLoRA) for _Channel Pruning_ 
```python3
from sp_adapters import SPLoRA
```
<div align="center">

</div>
Adds a low-rank bottle-neck projection in projection in parallel with the main weights projection.

### Structured Pruning Parallel Residual Adapter (SPPaRA) for _Channel Pruning_ of CNNs
```python3
from sp_adapters import SPPaRA
```
Adds a pointwise convolution as adapter to convolutional layers. First proposed in ["Efficient parametrization of multi-domain deep neural networks" by Rebuffi et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10082.pdf),

### Structured Pruning Low-rank PHM Adapter (SPLoPA) for _Block Pruning_ (experimental)
```python3
from sp_adapters import SPLoPA
```

<div align="center">

Uses a variation on the Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layer [[paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rcQdycl0zyk)] with shared low-rank prototypes for block-sparse adaptation.
